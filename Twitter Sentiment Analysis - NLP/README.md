# 🚀 Twitter Sentiment Analysis - Hate Speech Detection (NLP)

### 🔍 **Project Objective**

The goal of this project is to **detect hate speech in tweets** by identifying whether a tweet contains **racist or sexist sentiment**. For simplicity:

- **Label 1:** Tweet contains racist/sexist hate speech  
- **Label 0:** Tweet does **not** contain racist/sexist hate speech  

Given a dataset of tweets labeled accordingly, your task is to build a model that can **accurately classify tweets** as hateful or non-hateful.
