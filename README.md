## 📚 What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that empowers computers to **learn from data** and make decisions or predictions **without being explicitly programmed**. It plays a vital role in sectors like healthcare, finance, marketing, robotics, and more.
